# 🛡 NetSentry  
### Real-Time Network Monitoring & Intrusion Detection System

---

## 🚨 The Problem

Modern networks face continuous threats from malicious actors attempting unauthorized access through techniques such as **port scanning** and reconnaissance attacks.

These activities often go unnoticed in real-time, leaving systems vulnerable to:

- Intrusion Attempts  
- Service Exploitation  
- Data Breaches  
- Network Compromise  

---

## 💡 Our Solution

**NetSentry** is a real-time host-based network monitoring and intrusion detection system designed to:

✔ Capture live network packets  
✔ Log communication metadata  
✔ Analyze traffic patterns  
✔ Detect suspicious behavior  
✔ Generate real-time alerts  
✔ Visualize network activity via an interactive dashboard  

The system actively inspects network traffic generated by the host device and flags abnormal communication patterns indicative of potential attacks such as:

👉 **Port Scanning Attempts**

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Install Dependencies

    pip install -r requirements.txt

---

### Run Backend (Packet Sniffer)

⚠ Run with Administrator Privileges

    python run_backend.py

---

### Launch Dashboard

Open another terminal:

    python -m streamlit run dashboard/dashboard.py

Access Dashboard at:

    http://localhost:8501

---

## 🎬 Demo Instructions

To simulate network traffic:

    ping 8.8.8.8

This generates packets that are captured, analyzed, and visualized in real-time on the dashboard.

---

## 🔐 Detection Logic

NetSentry detects suspicious behavior such as:

> An IP communicating with multiple destination ports within a short duration.

This behavior is indicative of a potential **port scanning attempt**.

Upon detection, the system generates a real-time alert displayed on the dashboard.
